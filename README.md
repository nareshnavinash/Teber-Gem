## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'teber-library'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teber-library

## Usage

This gem is to replace the library methods in [Teber-Ruby](https://github.com/nareshnavinash/Teber-Ruby) framework. This allows us to share the methods among different teams and completely ignore the repetitive work. For more details on Page object model for functional UI automation verify [Teber Ruby Documentation](https://nareshnavinash.github.io/Teber-Ruby/) page.

### Adding new methods

Add all the new methods inside /lib/teber/ path with the module name as 'Teber'. If added a new file, include the newly added file to the /lib/teber/teber.rb so that those methods will be available when we use the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
